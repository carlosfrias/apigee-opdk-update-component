Apigee OPDK Update Component
=========

This repository contains an Ansible role to perform an update to a component of the Apigee platform. 

Requirements
------------

Previous installation of the Apigee platform on the node.

Role Variables
--------------

A description of the settable variables for this role should go here, including any variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role. Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.) should be mentioned here as well.

Dependencies
------------

None

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: apigee-pre-requisites-common-update }
